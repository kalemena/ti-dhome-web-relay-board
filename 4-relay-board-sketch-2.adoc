== 4 - Relay board sketch

Latest itretaion link:3-relay-board-sketch.adoc[First sketch] is not very efficient.

It only touched simple ESP8266 capability.

This iteration is about going deeper into the topic:

- host static files such as images or CSS files
- use the SPIFFS ~3MB flash storage
- better HTML rendering
- web sockets

=== Steps

==== Un coup dans le 'SPIFFS'

To leverage most of the 4MB disk from ESP8266, install plugin:

link:https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin[Arduino IDE SPIFFS plugin]

Usage is pretty simple:

- create subfolder from sketch folder named 'data'
- use Arduino IDE / Tools / ESP Sketch Data Upload
- this takes very long as it uploads ~ 3MB (no matter what)

==== Sketch details

The sketch can be found under link:sketches/esp8266-web-relay-advanced[web-relay-advanced] folder.

This is a basic sketch from SPIFFS example, with addition of relay web services.

SPIFFS is used only to load SVG images to be displayed on URL /index.htm.
