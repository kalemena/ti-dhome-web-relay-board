== 1 - Setup ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE

NOTE: Since this tutorial was written, I made available a link:https://github.com/kalemena/iot-tools[Docker Arduino IDE]

The development uses simple Arduino IDE with ESP8266 libs.

Follow this guide to setup ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE: link:https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino[]

Documentation is here: link:http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/[]

=== Procedure

- Import ESP Board into Arduino IDE

image:res/esp8266-board.png[Import ESP Boards]

- Load the Libraries for ESP8266

image:res/esp8266-libs.png[Load ESP libraries]

- Load sample *hello* app into NodeMCU

In Arduino IDE, select proper board, example:
- Tools/Cards/NodeMCU 1.0 board
- CPU 160 MHz
- <correct USB device>

Create sketch such as the link:sketches/esp8266-01-led/esp8266-01-led.ino[ESP8266 LED]

```js
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 2 as an output.
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}


// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
```

LED should blink as shown below:

- Control a Wifi LED
-- Upload sketch found at link:sketches/esp8266-02-led-wifi/esp8266-02-led-wifi.ino[ESP8266 LED WIFI] with changing Wifi network settings
-- Open Serial Consoleon Arduino IDE
-- Ensure from logs that NodeMCU connected to local Wifi
-- Browse to IP address logged out
-- Click on button to switch led On and Off
