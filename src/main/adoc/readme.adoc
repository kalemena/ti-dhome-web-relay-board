= Web Relay Board

== Description

This project is an Open Source / Open Hardware minimal approach to build a Web Relay Board.

This Web Relay Board:

- allows to connect 16 devices allowing to switch on/off Main Power
- has temperature / humidity sensor
- captures Téléinfo (France Electricity provider serial consumption data)
- has REST API
- has Web Socket API

WARNING: Caution with 230v. Do not use high current.

The Web Relay board uses HTTP/REST API as interface.
Additionaly, simple Web UI is implemented on top of the REST API.

In practice, the Web Relay is used to manage electric heaters with data wire named link:http://www.planete-domotique.com/blog/2012/01/05/piloter-un-radiateur-grace-a-son-fil-pilote/[fil pilote] which is 230v at very low current. The heaters are ochestrated through Node-Red.

NOTE: This project is part of a wider link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome[TiDhome Home Automation] project.

INFO: Above is an example of a dashboard created as part of Ti-Dhome project and using mostly Teleinfo data produces by the module in this repo, published to Node-Red through Web Sockets and inserted in Prometheus for Grafana use.

== Specifications

- 16 relays for 230v main current
- Wifi
- link:#api[REST API]
- WebSockets
- Reads EDF Téléinfo (France power consumption of the home as serial stream of data)
- Reads room temperature and humidity
- Simple web UI
