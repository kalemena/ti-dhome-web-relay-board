== 0 - Manual Setup ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE

NOTE: Since this tutorial was written, I made available a link:https://github.com/kalemena/iot-tools[Docker Arduino IDE]

The development uses simple Arduino IDE with ESP8266 libs.

Follow this guide to setup ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE: link:https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino[]

Documentation is here: link:http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/[]

=== Procedure

- Import ESP Board into Arduino IDE

image:esp8266-board.png[Import ESP Boards]

- Load the Libraries for ESP8266

image:esp8266-libs.png[Load ESP libraries]

- Load sample *hello* app into NodeMCU

In Arduino IDE, select proper board, example:
- Tools/Cards/NodeMCU 1.0 board
- CPU 160 MHz
- <correct USB device>

Create sketch such as the link:{giturl}/src/main/sketches/esp8266-01-led/esp8266-01-led.ino[ESP8266 LED]

```js
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 2 as an output.
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}


// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
```

LED should blink as shown below:

* Control a Wifi LED
** Upload sketch found at link:{giturl}/src/main/sketches/esp8266-02-led-wifi/esp8266-02-led-wifi.ino[ESP8266 LED WIFI] with changing Wifi network settings
** Open Serial Consoleon Arduino IDE
** Ensure from logs that NodeMCU connected to local Wifi
** Browse to IP address logged out
** Click on button to switch led On and Off

== 1 - Docker Setup ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE

See link:https://github.com/kalemena/iot-tools[Docker image kalemena:arduino:latest]

* check your tty device. e.g. /dev/ttyUSB2 and match it in *Makefile*
* open the Arduino IDE with:

[source,bash]
----
$ make arduino

== 2 - Breadboard relay board

image:breadboard-video.gif[Breadboard video]

Using Node MCU for Wifi, there are few remaining constraints:

- GPIOs are 3.3v and we need 5v: *ULN2803* to the rescue
    
    > ULN2803 is a Darlington array which can be used to translate from 3.3v digital outputs to 5v

- Not enough GPIOs: *74HC595* to the rescue
    
    > This components enables use of 3 GPIOs to be used in serial protocol to handle in our case the 16 outputs requires for relay board

=== Procedure

Few more details

==== 74HC595

image:74HC595-pins.png[74HC595 pins]

We will use 3 pins from Node MCU:

.wiring 74HC595
[width="80%",cols="3,^2,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|NodeMCU |74HC595 |Comment

| gpio13 (D7)   | pin 14        | data
| gpio14 (D5)   | pin 11        | clock (both 74HC595) 
| gpio15 (D8)   | pin 12        | latch (both 74HC595) 

|=========================================================

IMPORTANT: Ground and 3.3v plugged obviously.

IMPORTANT: 1st 74HC595 is connected to 2nd 74HC595 from pin 9 to pin 14.

NOTE: *We now have 16 I/Os through 3 ESP8266 pins!*

==== ULN2803

image:ULN2803-pins.jpg[ULN2803 pins]

.wiring ULN2803
[width="80%",cols="3,^2,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|74HC595 |ULN2803 |Comment

| 8    | 9         | Ground
| 5v (from power supply)   | 10        | *5v not the 3.3v here!*
| Q0 to Q7   | 1 to 8        | Outputs

== 3 - Relay board sketch

Now is time for a bit of coding.

=== How-To

Here is the first link:{giturl}/src/main/sketches/esp8266-04-web-relay-wifi/esp8266-04-web-relay-wifi.ino[Basic sketch]

Details of mathematics in next section.

Steps:

- Uploaded from Arduino IDE
- Open Arduino console
- This should log the URL with IP address to connect to Wifi device
- Connect using browser to see the table where you can switch on and off the relays

=== Mathematics

==== Binary computation

We have wired 16 outputs.

The outputs can be mapped to an integer from 0 to 65535.

In Arduino code, this means link:https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/UnsignedInt[__unsigned int__]

Let's see what this means from link:http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/BitMath#quickref[Byte mathematics]

```js
unsigned int relayState = 0;

// state of each relay (switchId is relay number from 0 to 15):
boolean switchState = ((relayState >> switchId) & 1);

// Set relay to 0:
relayState &= ~(1 << relayNb);

// Set relat to 1:
relayState |= (1 << relayNb);
```

==== 74HC595 - ShiftOut

The link:https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ShiftOut[74HC595 ShiftOut] states that it is 8 bit and requires two steps operation to shift bits.

```js
// Value is anything between 0 to 65535 representing 16 bits of data I/Os
void switchRelay(int value) 
{
   // take the latchPin low:
   digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW);

   // shift out the highbyte
   shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, (value >> 8));
   // shift out the lowbyte
   shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, value);

   //take the latch pin high so the LEDs will light up:
   digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH);
}
```

== 4 - Relay board sketch

This iteration is about going deeper into the topic:

- host static files such as images or CSS files
- use the SPIFFS ~3MB flash storage
- better HTML rendering
- web sockets

=== Steps

==== Un coup dans le 'SPIFFS'

To leverage most of the 4MB disk from ESP8266, install plugin:

link:https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin[Arduino IDE SPIFFS plugin]

Usage is pretty simple:

- create subfolder from sketch folder named 'data'
- use Arduino IDE / Tools / ESP Sketch Data Upload
- this takes very long as it uploads ~ 3MB (no matter what)

==== Sketch details

The sketch can be found under link:{giturl}/src/main/sketches/esp8266-05-web-relay-advanced[web-relay-advanced] folder.

This is a basic sketch from SPIFFS example, with addition of relay web services.

SPIFFS is used only to load SVG images to be displayed on URL /index.htm.

== 5 - ESP8266 - 12E

Switch from NodeMCU to ESP12.

WARNING: This is aborted story, but it was interesting study! Instead ESP32 might be of better interest.

== 6 - PCB based on NodeMCU WeMos

PCB sample details link:dist[here]

image:web-relay-board-nodemcu-pcb1.png[PCB Board ESP8266 WeMos,width="40%"]

PCB was printed at link:https://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/pcb&product_id=1351[DFRobot]

=== PCB - Fritzing

PCB was done using fritzing, the lazy way.

WARNING: Auto-routing did not work (as often) so all is routed manually.

See link:https://fritzing.org/home/[Fritzing]

Fritzing project can be found link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome-web-relay-board/blob/master/web-relay-board-nodemcu.fzz[here]

== 7 - WebSocket

Adding WebSocket code for Arduino and Web UI.

Also updated SPIFFS to LittleFS.

[TIP]
====
To test, +
- open Web UI at http://iotrelays.local/ +
- *curl http://iotrelays.local/test 

This initiate the rolling on/off test on each relay one by one. +
The UI should move according to relay current state because it receives web socket events.

== 8 - T/H and Teleinfo

Adding Sensors Temperature, Humidity and France Power (Teleinfo).

The board created in previous iterations supports a T/H sensor HTU21 and the components required for Teleinfo.

Examples:

== 9 - ESP 32

Switching to ESP32 with same form factor as Wemos D1 mini.

image:https://github.com/kalemena/iot-tools/blob/master/src/main/adoc/categories/pinouts/pinout-esp32-wemos-clone.png[ESP 32 pins]

Main differences with Wemos ESP8266:

* Pins are slightly different, but can fit previously created PCB without soldering
* ESP32 system info
* Wifi and WebServer libs don't allow same port WebSocket
* SoftwareSerial is replaced with HardwareSerial
* Web UI is enhanced to allow continuous update of power and temperature sensor
