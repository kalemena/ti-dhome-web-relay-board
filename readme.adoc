== Description

Web Relay Board is a connected IoT which allows to switch Main Power.

WARNING: Caution with 230v. Do not use high current.

The Web Relay board uses HTTP/REST API as interface.

Additionaly, simple Web UI is implemented on top of the REST API.

In practice, the Web Relay is used to manage electric heaters with data wire named link:http://www.planete-domotique.com/blog/2012/01/05/piloter-un-radiateur-grace-a-son-fil-pilote/[fil pilote] which is 230v at very low current.

NOTE: This project is part of a wider link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome[TiDhome Home Automation] project.

== Specifications

- 16 relays (10 heaters are wired, plus 4 actuators)
- Wifi
- REST API
- Simple web UI

= TODO

- more advanced sketch using static file (cached), images, web sockets?, etc
- switch to ESP12 instead of NodeMCU (Wemos)
- create 3D-printed plastic box

= Prototyping iterations

Here are described step by step experiments to reach final product.
