== 7 - WebSocket

Adding WebSocket code for Arduino and Web UI.

Also updated SPIFFS to LittleFS.

[TIP]
====
To test, 
- open Web UI at http://iotrelays.local/ 
- *curl http://iotrelays.local/test 

This initiate the rolling on/off test on each relay one by one.
The UI should move according to relay current state because it receives web socket events.
